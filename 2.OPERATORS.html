        <h1> LETS SEE ABOUT OPERATORS</h1>
        <hr>
        <h3 style="color:blue;background-color:yellow">Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, **, /, %, ++, --  <br>
            Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=  <br>
            Comparison Operators: ==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=, ?  <br>
            Logical Operators: &&, ||, !  <br>
            Bitwise Operators: &, |, ~, ^, <<, >>, >>>

<hr>
            <p> In this we have already learned about the operators , but there are some new operators like
                <br>
                <br>
               <mark>1.===</mark> <br>
                i.this is used to check equality very strictly by also considering the datatypes of both 
                <br>ii.because if a='6' , if(a==6 ) it gives true even a is a string because of inbuilt type conversion in js<br>
                iii.so in this case we can use === which gives false because both are diff data type
<br>
<br>
<mark>2.!==</mark>
<br>i. this is same as like === to check not eqaulity very strictly 
            </p>
            <p> <mark>3.>>></mark><br>
                <br>
               <mark> Signed Right Shift (>>):</mark>
<br>
                Keeps the sign bit (leftmost bit).
                For -8, the sign bit remains 1 after shifting.
                <br><mark>Unsigned Right Shift (>>>):</mark>
                
                <br>Does not preserve the sign bit.
                Fills the leftmost bits with 0 regardless of the sign. </p>

                <h3><mark>NOTES</mark></h3>
                <p>1.if the number is negative to preserve the sign the left and right shift operator fills the empty places with 1<br>
                2.if the number is positive to preserve the sign the left and right shift operator fills the empty places with 0<br></p>
